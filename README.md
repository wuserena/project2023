# Comparison and Analysis of Vision Transformer Variants
Last year, ChatGPT successfully captured public attention, and now we are anticipating the arrival of the next generation. Our research analyzes two Transformer-based backbones, Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer, o identify the optimal architecture for computer vision tasks. We aim to demonstrate how Transformers can be applied to vision problems and to understand the reasoning behind the networkâ€™s decisions.
